            My journey of design started in childhood, I was an enthusiast for cartoons. I used to wait till my school is
            completed just to watch these shows, which eventually led me to the hobby of drawing. Even though I wasn't
            very good at it, I enjoyed every moment of drawing pictures of the cartoon characters.

            Lockdown was one such serious time when people had their hard times surviving. Fear surrounding everywhere,
            physically yet mentally everyone was tired and needed a break out of the break. My whole lifestyle was
            changed. It was the time I started turning My drawings to give them a life. I was shocked to know there were
            24 drawings per second in a animation. I learnt not only dedication, it takes hard work to complete the task
            which we are dedicated to.

            My perspective of seeing things changed when I was introduced to the art of designing things. I was fascinated
            how everything in this world was designed for better living. Beautiful buildings engineered perfectly,
            hoardings, pamphlets, posters everything looked beautiful. I believe the internet is just an adaptation of
            real world we see in our daily life, which inspired me to design things in a minimalistic way for better
            living.
